## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

+  Before starting EDA, it is better to know what each variable stands for, or how they are measured, the units of numeric variables, or the categories of categorical variables, etc. If I am working with someone, I would present my questions and discuss them to my teammate. 

+  When performing EDA, first to check if there are any missing values or outliers that really stands out. Since there may be input error. Again, check with collaborator and document the process.  

+  Plot the data. It helps identify the pattern and trend of the data.   

+  Calculate summary statistics and maybe create new variables if needed.  

+  Provide a document that record the procedure, including data description, the reasoning behind the steps, as well as graphics and summaries.
