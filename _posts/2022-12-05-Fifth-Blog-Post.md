# What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  

After having this course, I believe I will do a better job for EDA of the data, also producing reasonable results(plots/tables/models). Also, there are multiple ways to communicating the results. It can be a UI, or knitted document, or even an API. This will be more flexible and I can decide which one is more appropriate depending on the situation, which is really great.  

# Data science (and statistics) is a huge field. What do you hope to do in relation to data science (and statistics) in your future career? What aspects/areas do you want to learn more about?  
For now, I have got in touch with several topics like experimental design, statistical learning, time series. Ultimately, I believe these are just ways to retrieve information from data. And there are always a lot of ways to do it. I think these methods, are just tools. The goal is to solve questions in reality. No matter whether it is a research question or a business strategy, we need to get some answers and tell people what to do given the data we have. But I prefer area in financial and biology, the questions in these fields appeal to me and it would be interesting to get to know about it.
