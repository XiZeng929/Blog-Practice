## Project 2 Summary

+ For this project, I interact with the Daily open/close endpoint for the Financial API by wring a `ConstructURL` function, I also did an exploratary data analysis for the data I queried from the API.
  Stock price is actually a reflection of the economic situation of a company.
  For the EDA, since one function call only pulls one observation, also with the limit to this API, it took me lot of work to figure it out how to pull the data without trigger the limits. The problem solving process for this is really interesting.
  
+  In this project, I did the `ConstructURL` function for the API part, also pulled data from 30 function calls and, manipulate and performed an EDA for my data. Actually, writing the function as well as data manipulation and EDA are not that difficult. The most difficult thing is to deal with the function call limit for the financial API. When trying to render our work at last, this also happens and produce some painful memories.

+  If I need to do a similar project in the future, I would make sure with the function call limit at first! Also, try to define the functions in a more user-friendly way, and have clear explanation for my code. I believe this would be really helpful to me, to my group member, and the user.
