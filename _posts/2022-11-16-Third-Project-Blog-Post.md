# Project 3 Reflection
+ what would you do differently?  
If I were to do this project again, I would start the automation part earlier. Since when we finished all the model fitting and EDA and try to automate our files, it takes us a lot of time to render the file, the model fitting already cost a lot of time, automating it for different channels is even worse.  Also, it will be more interesting if I choose over all the predictors available. Then it will require more computation.  

+ what was the most difficult part for you?  
I think the most different part would be to figure out how to automate the file and to degub when it doesn't work. I ended up comment out a lot of steps and check every object that I created in the automation part to see where went wrong. And also, without the knowledge of the running time, debug becomes really difficult.  

+ what are your big take-aways from this project?  
I learnt how to automating R markdown, also fitting models with `caret` package, also become more experienced with Github, and it has been really great to work and discuss with my group member!
