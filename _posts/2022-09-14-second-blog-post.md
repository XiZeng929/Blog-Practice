# Project 1 Reflection

+ The purpose of the project is to get familiar with data manipulation by tidyverse. Also, write our own function including generic functions.
+ I learned to define default variables in generic function, which is super helpful.
+ Since I started from scratch in R marndown directly. It cost me a lot of time to run code and debug. To write my code in R script then organize my R markdown would definitely save me a lot of time on this.
