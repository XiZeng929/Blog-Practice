# Variable Selection in Regression Models

+ To start, it is better to conduct a background search or literature review, possiblify find someone with expertise to filter some variables. Keep the variables that are proved to be effective.
+ Then, considering the computation cost and complexity, I would prefer backward selection or forward selection. It is not guaranteed but they can do a great job.
+ For model selection criterion, I would prefer AIC. Since there is a penalty term added, thus AIC would prefer models with less predictors. I believe this is better to keep models simple.
